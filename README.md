# YAST

Yet Another Scaffolding Tool is a all-in-one scaffolding tool to build starter applications. The goal is combining multiple commands into a single interactive command that works together seamlessly.

`yast webapp` will prompt the user for desired frontend framework (Svelte, React, Vue, etc.) and then prompt a user for desired backend technology (Spring, Django, dotnet). Yast will then create a generic project using this (Along with further inputs as the technology grows) that can easily be built upon.
